     * This idea is to link to our defined function when there is one, instead
     * of the function inside the library that the game wants to load.
     * However, there is a problem in this, encountered in Towerfall:
     * This game bundles with libpng 1.5.10, and load this library dynamically.
     * Also, the ffmpeg libraries that we use are usually compiled with png
     * support, which means that we statically link to our libpng (1.6.28 for me)
     * Thus, calling `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "png_xxx")` will return the function
     * from our installed libpng library, which has no reason to be of the same
     * version as the one bundled with the game.
     *
     * One solution would be to check if the symbol name is defined strictly
     * in our library, excluding any shared library dependency.
     * AFAIK, dlopen and dlsym always include all dependencies. Maybe by doing
     * some arithmetic pointer shenanigan?
